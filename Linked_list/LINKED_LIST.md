Memory is not wasted but extra memory is consumed as it also uses pointers to keep track of the next successive node.
Linked Lists are mostly used because of their effective insertion and deletion. 
Insertion and deletion in the linked list are very effective and take less time complexity as compared to the array data structure. 
This data structure is simple and can be also used to implement a stack, queues, and other abstract data structures.   

####  Applications of Linked Lists:
Linked Lists are used to implement stacks and queues.
It is used for the various representations of trees and graphs.
It is used in dynamic memory allocation( linked list of free blocks).
It is used for representing sparse matrices.
It is used for the manipulation of polynomials.
It is also used for performing arithmetic operations on long integers.
It is used for finding paths in networks.
#### Applications of Linked Lists in real world: 
The list of songs in the music player are linked to the previous and next songs. 
In a web browser, previous and next web page URLs are linked through the previous and next buttons.
In image viewer, the previous and next images are linked with the help of the previous and next buttons.
Switching between two applications is carried out by using “alt+tab” in windows and “cmd+tab” in mac book. It requires the functionality of circular linked list.
In mobile phones, we save the contacts of the people. The newly entered contact details will be placed at the correct alphabetical order. This can be achieved by linked list to set contact at correct alphabetical position.
The modifications that we make in documents are actually created as nodes in doubly linked list. We can simply use the undo option by pressing Ctrl+Z to modify the contents. It is done by the functionality of linked list.

#### Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
Use of pointers is more in linked lists hence, complex and requires more memory.
Searching an element is costly and requires O(n) time complexity.
Traversing is more time consuming and reverse traversing is not possible in singly linked lists.
Random access is not possible due to dynamic memory allocation.
